# GiFt

GiFt is a new multi-frequency graph filter-based placement acceleration approach, which can comprehensively capture the graph structure.

## Requirements
The “data” folder is used for data storage. 
Specifically, the “benchmark” folder contains the Floorplan results of the files to be placed, the “benchmark_parser” folder includes the adjacency matrices representing the topological relationships of the files to be placed, and the “data” folder stores the results after placement.

## How to Use
```bash
python main_real_data.py <filename>
```
